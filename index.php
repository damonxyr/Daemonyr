<p class="title">The Road Not Taken

<p>

<p>by Robert Frost</p>

<div class="content">

	<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood</p>
	<p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
	<p>And be one The traveler, long I stood</p>
	<p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
	<p>To where it bent in the undergrown</p>

	<p>Then took the other, as just as fair</p>
	<p>And having perhaps the better claim</p>
	<p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear</p>
	<p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
	<p>Had worn them really about the same</p>

	<p>And both that morning equally lay</p>
	<p>In leaves no step had trodden black</p>
	<p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
	<p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way</p>
	<p>I doubted if I should even come back</p>

	<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
	<p>Somewhere ages and ages hence</p>
	<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...</p>
	<p>I took the one less traveled by</p>
	<p>And that has made all the difference</p>
